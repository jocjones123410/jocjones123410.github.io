         * array.
         * - Each item is a dot-separated path to the desired reference within the
         *   result object, excluding the "reference" property. For example
         *   `context.serviceProvider` will look for `{Response}.context.serviceProvider.reference`.
         * - If the target is an array of references (E.g.
         *   [Patient.generalPractitioner](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient-definitions.html#Patient.generalPractitioner)), you can request one or more of them by index (E.g. `generalPractitioner.0`).
         *   If the index is not specified, all the references in the array will be
         *   resolved.
         * - The order in which the reference paths are specified does not matter.
         *   For example, if you use `["subject", "encounter.serviceProvider", "encounter"]`,
         *   the library should figure out that `encounter.serviceProvider` must be
         *   fetched after `encounter`. In fact, in this case it will first fetch
         *   subject and encounter in parallel, and then proceed to encounter.serviceProvider.
         * - This option does not work with contained references (they are "already
         *   resolved" anyway).
